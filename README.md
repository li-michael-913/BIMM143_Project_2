# BIMM143_Project_2

This project will be looking at the differences between the genes in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain (primarily A/California/04/2009) and non-pandemic strains such as A/PR/8/34 (the two strains will be referred to as CA4 and PR8). H1N1 is an influenza A virus (IAV) of the orthomyxoviridae family. It is a segmented dsDNA virus with 8 segments, each coding for a different protein. Although segments generaly code for 1 protein each, some can code for different proteins using alternative splicing and alternative start codons. Different strains of IAVs are categorized based on their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins (segments 4 and 6 respectively). In addition to looking at the different sequences of segments, this project will also be looking at the differences in host cell responses by looking at RNAseq data of infected cels' transcriptome.
